# PanicButton
Fun program that minimizes the foreground window and maximizes another in its place. AKA the boss button.

This program runs in the background and uses 2 hotkeys in order to function as a boss button. The first, CTRL+ALT+S, marks the current foreground window as the "work" window. This is the window that the program will switch to once the CTRL+ALT+V hotkey is pressed, which is essentially the panic hotkey. Once this key is hit, the current foreground window will be minimized, the work window brought to the foreground and then maximized.
